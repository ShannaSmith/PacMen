## Description:
This program uses Javascript to dynamically display data on a webpage.
It produces PacMen on demand. They are produced at the click of a button. Click the start button and each of them move around the browser window at their own pace. 
Decide how many PacMen you will make and watch them go.

## How To Play:
1. Place the HTML file in your browser.
2. Click "add PacMan" button". A new PacMan appears at a random positon on the screen.
3. Click the "Start Game" button. The Pacmen will begin moving at random velocity on the screen, changing direction to remain within the frame of the web page.

### Roadmap of Future Improvements
1.  Have each PacMan track a dot.
2.  Add a black background.
3.  Make the buttons more stylist.
